    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Commands</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">The input box of the console app accepts a list of commands that trigger app functions rather than send messages. These are mostly for GM use, but players do have access to a few commands. To use a command type one of the following command names prepended by a forward slash. E.g. /invite player 1</span></p>

    </ul>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Anchoring</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">A console window can be set to anchor. An anchored window cannot be closed and will remain open even when a user presses the 'Esc' key to close all open windows. A GM can configure a console to be anchored by default or not. An anchored window can still be closed by clicking on the anchor icon in the top right and then clicking the close button.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Archiving</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Any console can be archived by a GM by selecting the archive option in the right-click drop down menu. This action is irreversible and will prompt you to confirm. On confirmation, the console is turned into a page in the _console-data journal entry. After which, the console is deleted from the manager.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">As of yet there is no way to un-archive a console.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>_console-data</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">This journal entry is what stores all of the data for this module. The module fetches this journal entry by name. As such, this journal entry should not be renamed lest you lose access to all of your consoles data. Further, any archived consoles appear as pages within this journal entry. Feel free to move it into folders or duplicate it for a backup.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Console visibility to players</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Whether or not a console is shown to players is controlled by the GM using two different variables; visibility and ownership. Players only see consoles in their console manager that are both visible and that they have ownership over. Which players have ownership over a console can be configured in the console config window and visibility can be toggled from the console drop down menu.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">As a GM you can bypass these restrictions to show a console to players even if it is neither visible nor owned by players. In the consoles top header click the eye icon to show to players. From here you can choose to show it just to players who have ownership or to all players. Further, console windows rendered through macros can be shown to players regardless of its visibility or ownership.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Macro support</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">The <code class="readme-code">ConsoleApp</code> and <code class="readme-code">ConsoleData</code> classes are globally exposed and should be all you need if you want to integrate consoles into macros. Works wonderfully to show consoles to players in certain map spaces using foundrys <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/article/scene-regions/">regions tools</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ironmonk88/monks-active-tiles">monks-active-tiles</a>.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Message word/character limits</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">You can configure a console to cut off messages after a certain amount of words/characters. You choose whether to cut off based on words or based on characters and you choose just how many. Further, you can choose a 'marker', a string of characters that get added to the end of a message that is cut off by the limit to alert you to the fact the message has been cut off.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">No more counting out your words for the <em>Sending</em> spell in DnD5e.</span></p>
    <h3 style="border:none"><span style="font-family: monospace"><strong>Timestamps</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-family: monospace">Integrates with <a href="https://github.com/vigoren/foundryvtt-simple-calendar">SimpleCalendar</a> to get date and time information that can be automatically added to sent messages. Module settings menu 'Date-time format' allows you to define custom timestamps that will piece togther different bits of data from SimpleCalendar however you like.</span></p>
